        <p><b>Data Glove</b></p>
        <p>This project aims to present the development of a prototype of a low-cost and low consumption teleoperation system, capable of making human movements acquisitions from the hand and forearm of a human operator, which can be adapted for different applications. The proposed device consists of three main elements: mechanical structure printed in 3D, sensing system, and teleoperation system. The 3D structure is designed to mold human members (hand and forearm), ensuring mechanical stability and comfort to the user. The sensing of the equipment, which has the function of promoting the acquisition of data on the movement of the hand and forearm, it's composed of an inertial sensor fixed in hand, infrared sensors on flexible structures in the fingers, and a mechanical structure with a resistive sensor that interconnects the joint of the hand with the forearm. Finally, the teleoperation system developed with low consumption hardware, which processes the data from the sensors and transmits them through wireless communication (Radio Frequency).</p>

        <p>This work presents the development of a device to improve monitoring in the fermentation process of alcoholic beverages, to automate this density monitoring and reduce the risks of contamination and waste of the product to be fermented. In the project was taken into consideration the development of a hardware, able to make the acquisition of density from the accelerometer sensor and temperature sensor. And that you can send this acquisition information to the customer through wireless communication using low-power Bluetooth (BLE). And a device that meets the requirements of food safety, which can be inserted into the fermenter, without running risks of contamination of the alcoholic beverage during the fermentation process.</p>

        <p><b>Assistive Device</b></p>
        <p>This project aims to present the development of an assistive technology system using 3D printing, achievable to reproduce, redesign and low cost of the structural model. The literature presents several studies whose system control is automated or have only one control site method, a fact that can make it possible to perform unwanted actions by the user. In the present project, it was decided to carry out acquisitions of two different control sites from user commands: movements from the user's jaw or lips and head. To avoid control errors and intuitive control increases. Thus, applications such as navigation in virtual interfaces, control of a wheelchair or robotic limbs are aimed. The device is composed of different parts being processing and communication hardware, sensors and 3D printed mechanical structure. The 3D structure was designed tointerconnect the sensors and the processing and communication hardware in a single physical structure, and that guarantees a strategic positioning of the sensors. The device has sensors, such as an inertial sensor that detects the movements of the head, and the joystick for detecting the movements of the jaw or lips.Finally, the device allows this detected data to be processed and sent to the receiving system by various communication protocol methods: WIFI, Bluetooth or USB.</p>

        <p>3Bot Board is a hardware that was developed to be used in didactic applications in robotics, such as in robotics competitions and even as a didactic platform to acquire knowledge in electronics and embedded systems. This hardware contains several external I/Os, so that it is possible to connect both digital and analog sensors or trigger something like relays, LEDs, Servo Motors, etc. Bluetooth or WIFI modules can also be connected, as a serial bus is available for this. Two H bridges are already present on the board, which can be used to drive and control DC motors that can consume up to 2A of current. The power supply features an on and off switch, battery polarity inversion protection and a switched regulator to regulate input voltages from up to 23V to 3v3, the ideal voltage for powering the microcontroller and all digital electronics. In addition, it contains components such as LEDs, switches and buzzer already present in the hardware.</p>

    <h4><b>About Me</b></h4>
    <p>Control and Automation Engineer, graduated from the Federal University of Uberlândia in May 2022. I am currently doing a master's degree in Biomedical Engineering, in the line of research "Wireless energy transfer and communication with implantable bioelectronic devices". And I also take part in Research and Development (R&D) projects subsidized by Petrobas, at the Structural Mechanics Laboratory (LMEst), where I hold the position of Junior Engineer on the team, with Embedded Hardware and Firmware developer functions. In these projects, I acquired experience in the development of hardware that needs to contain intrinsically safe characteristics, to be used in classified areas. I also have experience in the development of radio frequency circuit hardware such as Zigbee, Bluettoth, Wifi and LTE communication protocols, which must contain strict design criteria in their PCB (Printed Circuit Board) layout. In addition to this knowledge acquired through professional experience, I also acquired other knowledge through hobbies such as 3D printing and modeling, and soldering electronic components on PCBs.</p>
